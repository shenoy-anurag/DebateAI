We‚Äôve learned a lot \\nsince then.\\nIn the 1800s, a monk named Gregor Mendel figured out \\nthat traits of pea plants‚Äîlike whether peas were yellow or \\ngreen‚Äîwere passed down from parent to child in a way that \\ncould sometimes hide traits so they appeared to skip a genera-\\ntion. He figured out how to predict whether and when a hidden \\ntrait would show up next.\\nAround the same time, naturalist Charles Darwin figured \\nout that species evolve over time. The traits of pets and crops \\nare influenced by a farmer who breeds them, but according to \\nDarwin‚Äôs theory of evolution by natural selection, it is nature, \\nrather than human judgment, that determines which creatures \\nlive long enough to have offspring. Darwin knew the whole \\nidea hinged on some mysterious way that parents can pass \\ndown traits to their children, but he had no idea how that might \\nwork.\\nAnd then, in the 1950s, Rosalind Franklin managed to \\nform DNA into a crystal and take an x-ray photograph that \\nrevealed its structure. James Watson and Francis Crick built \\non her work to deduce that the DNA molecule had the shape \\nof a double helix and that DNA‚Äôs structure was uniquely suited \\nto pass down traits from one generation to the next.

We‚Äôll also talk about genomics, which is a related \\nfield that studies the totality of all the information contained in \\nyour DNA. Along the way, we‚Äôll cover other bits of biology as \\nneeded. We‚Äôll do all this with a focus on you and what‚Äôs going on \\nin your body, plus a few things you might see in the news.\\nAlong the way, we‚Äôll take some detours to visit the genomes \\nof animals, plants, bacteria, and even viruses. You have more in \\ncommon with all of these creatures than you probably realize.  \\nFirst, we‚Äôll learn about the nuts and bolts of deoxyribonucleic \\nacid‚ÄîDNA‚Äîitself. It‚Äôs a stringy substance that, on a smaller-\\nthan-microscopic scale, is an incredibly long molecule. You have \\nforty-six of these strands stuffed into the nucleus of each cell in \\nyour body, and each strand contains instructions for building \\nand maintaining every part of your body. These instructions are \\nin a chemical language that we‚Äôll learn to decode.\\nWe‚Äôll see how your cells read that code and carry out the \\ninstructions. Often the instructions tell the cells to build a pro-\\ntein, so we‚Äôll learn what these proteins do too. Some of them \\ngive your eyes and hair and skin their distinctive colors. Some \\nhelp your body to process food and drugs. Some are so impor-\\ntant to the way your body functions that if they aren‚Äôt built in \\nexactly the right way, you could end up with an increased risk \\nfor cancer or other health conditions.'),\n",

But how does it do that?\\nTo answer that question, we have to zoom in to a level even \\nsmaller than what microscopes can see. DNA is a long, stringy mol -\\necule whose job is to carry information. To understand that, think for \\na minute about this book. It‚Äôs just letters, one after another, that taken \\ntogether form words and sentences and chapters. A DNA strand is \\nmade up of millions of chemical components that function like let -\\nters, spelling out an instruction manual with all the information it \\ntakes to build and run a human body. (Or an animal‚Äôs body or even a \\nplant or a bacterium. Every living thing has DNA.)\\nNoncoding DNA\\nThere‚Äôs more to our DNA than just recipes, though. Think of the genome as a \\ndeluxe cookbook with a ton of extra information, like how to plan a dinner party \\nor suggested menus for a week‚Äôs dinners. That information is helpful so you \\nknow when to make the recipes. But it‚Äôs also a sloppy cookbook: there might \\nbe three versions of the same dish, and only one of them is worth making. \\nPerhaps there are even some recipe cards and scraps of paper tucked into the \\npages, things that you‚Äôre not quite sure where they came from but you‚Äôre not \\nsure if it‚Äôs okay to throw them away. Our DNA has scraps like that too.'),\n",

If \\nyou printed it out, our genome ‚Äîall the information carried in our \\nDNA‚Äîwould fill twelve thousand books this size.\\nOur genome isn‚Äôt just one string of DNA; it‚Äôs actually split into \\npieces called chromosomes. I like to think of our twenty-three chro-\\nmosomes as a recipe collection in twenty-three enormous volumes. \\nLike a real cookbook, DNA contains short sets of instructions‚Äîthink \\nof them as recipes. Each recipe, or gene, contains the instructions to \\nmake one tiny piece of who we are.\\nSince we are all different, our recipes vary slightly. My genes include \\ninstructions on how to make a brown pigment and put it into my hair fol-\\nlicles. But your hair may be colored differently from mine if your genes \\nencode a recipe for a different pigment. Or perhaps that page in your \\nrecipe book is blank, and you don‚Äôt put any pigment in your hair at all.\\nYou have two copies of this cookbook encyclopedia in each cell of \\nyour body. Cells are, in a sense, the kitchens where the recipes are made.\\nWHAT IS A CELL?\\nYour body contains over thirty-seven trillion cells. That‚Äôs a huge \\nnumber, right? You have more cells in your body than there are dol -\\nlars in the national debt or stars in the Milky Way.\\nYou have skin cells, muscle cells, fat cells, nerve cells, and bone \\ncells, just to name a few. They‚Äôre all so small you can only see them \\nwith a microscope.

This \\nmix of DNA and protein, called chromatin , gets tightly wrapped \\ninto a cylindrical shape‚Äîstill very long, but think of it more like a \\nrope than a strand of thread. Normally, some of our DNA is in this \\ncondensed form, while other stretches of it are looser.\\nWhen it‚Äôs time for a cell to divide, the ropes of DNA coil up even \\ntighter, forming a fat sausage shape.

We‚Äôll learn more about proteins in the ‚ÄúWhat Proteins \\nDo‚Äù section, but for now you just need to know that we make a ton of \\ndifferent ones. Your muscles, for example, owe their strength to pro-\\nteins called actin and myosin that can contract to shorten the muscle. \\nYour blood can carry oxygen to keep you alive thanks to a protein \\ncalled hemoglobin in your red blood cells. And your digestive tract \\ncan break down food thanks to a variety of digestive enzymes pro -\\nduced by the stomach, pancreas, and small intestine. Each of these \\nproteins, and thousands more, needs to be carefully built from the \\ninstructions contained in your genes.\\nThe two major steps in making the protein are:\\n1. Copying the gene by creating a new molecule of RNA with a \\nmatching sequence of bases. This is called transcription .\\n2. Building the protein according to the instructions in the RNA. \\nThis step is called translation.\\nIf it‚Äôs hard to remember which one is which, remember that when \\nwe transcribe something in real life, we are usually writing down \\nsomething that happened in a recording. Both the speech and the \\nwriting are in the same language. Similarly, the RNA is in the same \\n‚Äúlanguage‚Äù of nucleotides as DNA‚Äîjust a different dialect, as we‚Äôll'),\n",

But converting the language of nucleotides into the language of \\nprotein is a tougher job, and it really is more like translation.\\nOr you can just remember that in the alphabet, the c (in transcrip-\\ntion) comes before the l (in translation). That works too.\\nThe Central Dogma\\nIn 1957, Francis Crick, already famous for his role in discovering the structure \\nof DNA, gave a lecture in which he explained a hypothesis he had: that ‚Äúthe \\nmain function of the genetic material is to control‚Ä¶the synthesis of proteins.‚Äù \\nHe argued that the information in a nucleic acid like RNA can be used to make \\nproteins, but not vice versa, and called this idea the ‚ÄúCentral Dogma‚Äù of molec-\\nular biology. A variation on this, the rule of thumb that DNA is transcribed into \\nRNA, and that RNA is translated into protein, is part of every genetics student‚Äôs \\neducation today.\\nThe only problem is that it‚Äôs not really a dogma. Dogma  is a religious term \\nfor a set of principles that some authority declares to be true and everybody \\nmust believe it. That‚Äôs not how science works!

The name stuck.\\nWHAT IS RNA?\\nRNA is ribonucleic acid. Compare that to DNA‚Äôs full name, deoxyri -\\nbonucleic acid. These two molecules are very close relatives.\\nLike DNA, RNA is made of nucleotides that in turn are each made \\nof a phosphate, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base.

They \\ncontain useful chunks of genetic instructions, and we call those chunks \\nthe exons. But in between those exons are long stretches of RNA that \\ndon‚Äôt help code for the protein. These garbage sequences are the introns, \\nand the purpose of splicing is to cut out the introns and get rid of them.\\nSo wait, why do we have introns in the first place? Often because \\nthe gene can be read multiple ways. Cut out these introns, and you \\nhave one protein. Or cut out a different set of introns, and you‚Äôll get \\nsomething else entirely. This is called alternative splicing.\\nOther kinds of processing happen too. For example, a team of \\nenzymes adds a ‚Äútail‚Äù of hundreds of adenosine nucleotides to \\nthe mRNA. This tail protects the mRNA from being degraded, or \\nbroken down, too quickly. It also helps other proteins to recognize \\nthe mRNA as something that‚Äôs ready to be carried out of the nucleus.\\nOnce the mRNA has been created, processed, and edited, it‚Äôs \\ntime for the mRNA to leave the nucleus and head out to where the \\nribosomes are waiting.'),\n",

(That‚Äôs why you have to make \\nsure you‚Äôre eating plenty of protein if you‚Äôre working out and trying to \\nbuild muscle.) Our muscle cells are long and skinny, and they‚Äôre filled \\nwith long, thin structures called myofibrils that are made of protein. \\nEach myofibril has two different kinds of protein, called actin  and \\nmyosin. Both are made of smaller proteins glued into long ropes, but \\nthe myosin rope has little lumps on it‚Äîthink of them like hands or \\nhooks‚Äîthat can grab onto the actin. When we want to contract our \\nmuscles, the myosin grabs onto the actin and pulls, over and over, like \\nyou would pull on a rope in a game of tug-of-war. Through this, the \\nactin and myosin slide together. When we relax or extend our muscles, \\nthe myosin and actin slide back to their original positions.\\nThe visible parts of our hair and skin are made of a tough, water-\\nproof protein called keratin .

In fact, \\nmany of the vitamins and minerals we need in our diet are helper \\nmolecules for our enzymes.\\nWhat‚Äôs an Enzyme?\\nAn enzyme is a protein with a job. Specifically, enzymes catalyze chemical \\nreactions. They may take apart a specific type of molecule, or they may put \\na molecule together. Each enzyme has a very particular job, so one enzyme \\ncan‚Äôt fill in for another.

The same gene can actually be spliced \\nin more than one way to make multiple proteins.\\nFor example, cells in the thyroid make a hormone called calcito -\\nnin by splicing four exons together. But cells in the hypothalamus, a \\ngland near the brain, make a different protein out of the exact same \\ngene. Its first three exons are the same as the first three of calcitonin, \\nbut then it skips the fourth and cuts out several other pieces that the \\ncalcitonin gene throws away. The result is a different protein, which \\ngot the boring but descriptive name of CGRP, for ‚Äúcalcitonin gene-\\nrelated peptide.‚Äù\\nThe mRNA can also be edited in smaller ways.

Fortunately, when the cell is getting ready to divide, it \\nexpresses proteins and RNAs that help package the DNA into those \\ndense structures we learned about, the chromosomes.\\nThere‚Äôs another special thing that happens during that prepara -\\ntion stage. The entire cell is getting bigger, accumulating more of \\neverything. After all, the finished cells will each be half the size of \\nthe original cell, so most cells enlarge before they divide to give their \\ndaughter cells (yep, that‚Äôs the technical term) a head start.\\nDuring this stage, the DNA in the nucleus is making its own \\npreparations. Specifically, it copies itself, or replicates . That way, \\nthere are two copies of the DNA, one for each of the daughter cells.\\nReplication\\nWhen DNA copies itself, the process is called replication. It looks a little like tran-\\nscription: the DNA strand has to unzip, but now instead of an RNA polymerase \\ncoming in, it‚Äôs a DNA polymerase. This enzyme knows how to make DNA that \\nmatches one of the now-exposed strands. Another copy of DNA polymerase will \\ndo the same thing on the other side of the ladder. In fact, it takes many, many \\nDNA polymerases, all working at the same time, to copy our entire genome.\\nLet‚Äôs take a minute to count what exactly has doubled. But first, \\nhere‚Äôs what has not. A regular cell, not dividing, has forty-six chromo-\\nsomes. (Twenty-three of each, if you‚Äôre genetically female.

The resulting chromosome is in the shape of a letter ‚ÄúX.‚Äù\\nEach of the two new strands is called a chromatid, and the middle \\npart, where they are joined, is the centromere . This whole division \\nsituation is why chromosomes have a centromere at all. When the \\ncell is preparing to divide, the centromere attracts a group of pro -\\nteins called the kinetochore. And the kinetochore is what helps the \\nDNA get doled out to each new cell equally.\\nTHE JOY OF DIVISION\\nThe process that splits chromosomes is called mitosis. In humans and \\nother mammals, the membrane around the nucleus, called the nuclear \\nenvelope, disintegrates.

A microtubule from each side of the cell grabs onto each \\nchromosome at the kinetochore. Other tubules grab onto their counter-\\nparts coming from the other side of the cell. Then, as the microtubules \\npush on each other to push the two ends of the cell apart, the microtubules \\nthat are connected to chromosomes begin to shrink. Since they are firmly \\nattached to the chromosomes, the chromosomes get pulled apart.\\nThis is how we can be sure one chromatid goes to each end of the \\ncell.

Think about what happens if you begin pulling the two strands \\nof DNA apart: you get a little area where they are separated, called \\nthe replication bubble, and at each end of this is a shape we call the \\nreplication fork. We need to duplicate both strands on both sides of \\nthe replication fork, so that takes a minimum of four sets of replica -\\ntion machinery.\\nBut it‚Äôs actually a little more complicated than that.

But the entire process of making sperm takes a long time‚Äî\\nabout seventy-four days. (Many batches of sperm are made at once.)\\nInside the testes are long squiggly tubes called seminiferous \\ntubules, and inside those are stem cells called spermatogonia that \\nconstantly undergo mitosis, the process of cell division we learned \\nabout in the last section. When one of these stem cells divides, it \\njust makes more cells identical to itself. This process keeps a steady \\nsupply of this type of cell.\\nWhat happens next, though, is special. The spermatogonia \\nundergo a two-step process called meiosis to create sperm cells. We \\nneed a special process, rather than just another round of mitosis, \\nbecause sperm cells need to be haploid , meaning they only carry \\none of each chromosome pair‚Äîtwenty-three individual chromo -\\nsomes, not forty-six.'),\n",

Each cell will have half of \\nthe original cell‚Äôs DNA.\\nSo the DNA in each chromosome duplicates, resulting in \\nX-shaped chromosomes where the two identical strands are joined \\nin the middle. But instead of dividing right away, the cells spend a \\nlittle bit of time in this first stage, called prophase I, letting the chro-\\nmosomes‚Äô DNA mingle with each other.\\nThat means that if you are the one making sperm, your chro -\\nmosome 1 from Dad gets duplicated, and your chromosome 1 from \\nMom does too. Then Mom‚Äôs and Dad‚Äôs copies sit around for a little \\nwhile, and while they do, they link up with each other. Dad‚Äôs dupli -\\ncated chromosome sticks on to Mom‚Äôs.

Purple flowers are \\n‚Äúdominant‚Äù over white flowers because the purple flowers know how \\nto produce the purple pigment, and the white flowers do not.\\nHere‚Äôs an example using flowers:\\nIf the male parent has purple flowers and comes from a purebred \\nline of plants, it will have two alleles that make a purple pigment. \\nMendel used capital and lowercase letters, so in his tradition the \\npurple-flowered plant would have a genotype of PP.\\nAnd let‚Äôs say the female parent, also a purebred, has white flow -\\ners. That parent‚Äôs nonfunctional pigment gene is designated with a \\nlowercase ‚Äúp,‚Äù so its genotype is pp.\\nWhen the two parents mate, the male in our example makes hap-\\nloid pollen that only carry one of the flower color alleles each. Each \\ngrain of pollen carries a P. Meanwhile, the female parent can only \\nmake ovules (female gametes) with the p alleles that it carries. That \\nmeans that every offspring from this couple has the genotype Pp .\\nSince a plant with the Pp genotype can still make the purple pig-\\nment, these plants will have purple flowers.

One type, the rod cell, just regis-\\nters whether light hits it or not, and zaps a signal down the optic nerve \\nto the brain. The brain can perceive an image based on which rod cells \\ngot turned on and which didn‚Äôt.

As far as our brain knows, the dark is a black-and-white world.\\nWhat Colors Can You See?\\nHumans have three colors of cones, but other animals don‚Äôt see the same way \\nwe do. Most mammals have just two: one blue and one yellowish. If you‚Äôve heard \\nthat dogs are ‚Äúcolor blind,‚Äù that‚Äôs true in the same sense that people are often \\ncolor blind. They will have trouble distinguishing red from green, but they do still \\nsee in color. Meanwhile, other creatures have different light receptors than ours. \\nBees can see ultraviolet light, for example, which is why flowers sometimes have \\nspots and patterns that are invisible to our eyes‚Äîbut they‚Äôre obvious to the bees!\\nBut in the daylight, the rod cells all register light, so they‚Äôre not \\nhelpful in putting together a picture. Fortunately, our cone cells are \\nup for the job. We have three types of cone cells. Most of us, anyway.'),\n",

This is the gene that most \\nother mammals, like dogs, do not have. The gene that makes opsin \\nfor green cones is known as OPN1MW. Right next to it on the X chro-\\nmosome is the gene for the red opsins, OPN1LW. We may actually \\nhave more than one copy of each of these genes, just lined up next \\nto each other.\\nWhen the X chromosomes stick together during meiosis, it‚Äôs a \\nlittle too easy for the red and green opsin genes to get mixed up. \\nThe recombination process normally just swaps DNA between chro-\\nmosomes, but if there are near-identical sequences too close to each \\nother, it‚Äôs possible that they don‚Äôt match up correctly. It‚Äôs like when \\nyou button your shirt wrong: the buttonhole right below the correct \\none is still a buttonhole, so you can end up putting all the buttons in \\nthe wrong holes before you realize what you‚Äôve done.\\nWhen this happens to chromosomes in recombination, they can \\nend up swapping the wrong amount of genetic material. The result \\ncan be that one chromosome is just a little too short or too long. That \\nmeans the red or the green opsin genes can end up getting deleted \\nin one of the resulting cells. Or if recombination occurs in the middle \\nof a gene, you could end up with a hybrid protein that detects a color \\nthat is somewhere in between red and green.

Or, instead of a methyl \\ngroup, an enzyme might add an acetyl group (-CH 3CO) or a phos -\\nphate (-PO 4). Certain histone modifications recruit enzymes that \\nmethylate DNA, and vice versa, so these two methods of silencing \\ngenes often end up reinforcing each other.\\nChromatin Structure in Epigenetics\\nHistone modifications can also determine how tightly DNA is packed. When \\nthe DNA is packed up so tightly it can‚Äôt be transcribed, that‚Äôs heterochromatin. \\nThe opposite, euchromatin, is DNA that‚Äôs loosely packed and that the cell is \\nable to use.\\nNoncoding RNAs also help regulate chromatin structure.

But if there is a methyl group at the ninth lysine residue of \\nH3, and methyl groups on the cytosines in the DNA, that chromatin \\nis inactive. There are more possible configurations, and these are \\ncalled the histone code. However, different organisms use this code \\ndifferently, and scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how to \\nread it.\\nPARENTAL IMPRINTING\\nEven though we have two copies of all our genes‚Äîone from each \\nparent‚Äîsometimes we only use one or the other. These genes are \\nimprinted by the sperm or the egg cell, so that our cell sees the two \\ncopies as different. (This only happens for a small percentage of our \\ngenes, perhaps 1 percent, although that number may turn out to be \\nlarger as scientists learn more about epigenetics.)\\nThe gene for insulin-like growth factor 2, IGF2, is only expressed \\nin humans from the paternally imprinted allele (in other words, the \\none you got from your father or whoever provided the sperm). Some \\ngenes are expressed differently depending on which parent contrib-\\nuted them. One mutation, in a part of chromosome 15 that encodes \\nthe UBE3A gene, causes a disorder called Angelman syndrome if \\na child inherits it from their mother.

In that \\ncase, the dog will be a pale color, and we‚Äôll call it a yellow lab.\\nQUANTITATIVE TRAITS\\nMost of our traits are complex ones, involving far more than the two \\ngenes that contribute to Labrador retrievers‚Äô fur color. (Actually, \\neven labs have more genes involved in fur color than just the ones \\nwe mentioned previously. For example, there is a third gene that \\ndetermines whether a yellow lab is a pale or a darker yellow.)\\nAfter all, there aren‚Äôt just two heights of human beings, as you \\nwould expect if there was a single gene for height. There is  a single \\ngene that controls whether a person has achondroplasia (one type of \\ndwarfism), but it acts in addition to other genes that tweak your exact \\nmeasurement.\\nHow many genes affect height? A lot, it turns out. Scientists have \\ncombed through the genomes of people of various heights and found \\nmore than seven hundred different variations that seem to be linked \\nto height in some way. For example, if people who have one allele are \\nconsistently a smidge taller than people with a different allele at that \\nlocus, it goes on scientists‚Äô ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù list.'),\n",

Here are a few you may have \\nheard of or may be able to observe yourself.\\nLACTASE PERSISTENCE\\nAs babies, nearly everyone is able to drink and digest milk. About \\n40 percent of the calories in human milk come from a sugar called \\nlactose, so babies are equipped with an enzyme called lactase. (Note \\nthe spelling: words ending in -ose  are sugars; those ending in - ase \\nare enzymes.) But as we get older, the lactase gene gets turned off. \\nNothing wrong with that‚Äîafter all, it‚Äôs not like twenty-year-olds need \\nto breastfeed. If you don‚Äôt have lactase, and you drink a lot of milk, \\nyou‚Äôll feel gassy and bloated, and maybe have diarrhea. It isn‚Äôt a life-\\nthreatening condition, but it‚Äôs not pleasant.\\nBut somewhere along the line, humans started keeping animals \\nfor their meat and milk. If you ferment milk, for example, turning it \\ninto yogurt, bacteria grow in the yogurt, making chemical changes \\nto the milk. As a result, the milk becomes more acidic, which pre -\\nvents other bacteria from growing in it. That means it‚Äôs a form of food \\npreservation. The bacteria also have their own lactase enzyme, so in \\na sense they are digesting the lactose for us.'),\n",

Besides \\nyogurt, there‚Äôs also kefir and thousands of different types of cheeses. \\nBut one day‚Äîwe think about 7,500 years ago‚Äîsomebody in Europe \\nwas born with an accidental tweak to their genome: their lactase \\ngene never turned off.\\nThat person and their descendants were able to drink milk \\nstraight from the cow without worrying about diarrhea. That was a \\nuseful enough mutation that people who had it were more likely to \\nsurvive, or at least had more children, than those who didn‚Äôt. They \\ncould get the extra nutrients from milk without having to take the \\ntime to make it into yogurt or cheese. Today, around 90 percent of \\npeople from northern Europe can digest lactose as adults, compared \\nto fewer than 5 percent of people from Asia.\\nMost commonly, lactase persistence is a trait from a single gene, \\nand it is dominant. People with two recessive alleles are sometimes \\ncalled ‚Äúlactose intolerant.‚Äù Even though there is a gene clearly linked \\nto this trait, environment does play a role. The bacteria in your large \\nintestine are what create the symptoms of lactose intolerance as they \\ndigest the lactose that your body didn‚Äôt. The exact balance of bacte -\\nria in your body can affect how strongly you feel the symptoms. So, \\nof course, do your eating habits: you can‚Äôt react badly to milk if it‚Äôs \\nsomething you never drink.\\nEARWAX AND SWEAT ODOR\\nIs your earwax gooey, sticky, and golden brown? If so, you have ‚Äúwet‚Äù \\nearwax. Or perhaps your ears contain something more crumbly or \\nflaky that has a grayish color. That‚Äôs ‚Äúdry‚Äù earwax.'),\n",

A gene called OCA2 makes a protein that \\nwe use to manufacture melanosomes, little nuggets of pigment that \\ncan color our eyes. If you have brown eyes, this gene is probably fully \\nfunctional, and it puts pigment-containing melanosomes into the \\niris of your eye.\\nIf you don‚Äôt have brown eyes, that might be because your version \\nof this gene makes a protein that doesn‚Äôt do the job. Geneticists once \\nthought this was the whole story: either you have brown eyes thanks \\nto one pigment gene, or else you‚Äôre missing it and you have blue eyes.\\nThere are other genes that affect eye color.

If you answered with a \\nsmall number, you‚Äôre probably wrong. Sure, we can group hair colors \\ninto categories like red, blond, brown, and black. But if you analyze \\nenough samples of hair, you‚Äôll find enough variation to conclude that \\nthere must be more than a few genes involved.\\nBlack or brown hair contains a pigment called eumelanin. Just \\nas in Labrador retrievers (see ‚ÄúTraits Caused by Many Genes‚Äù sec -\\ntion), it may be brownish or it may be jet black. Another pigment \\nis pheomelanin, which appears red. These pigments occur in other \\nparts of your body, not just your hair. You can thank eumelanin for \\nbrown freckles, and pheomelanin for pink lips. Red hair is full of \\npheomelanin, with little to no eumelanin. And black or brown hair is \\npacked with eumelanin, although it may also have pheomelanin as \\nwell. If you bleach your brown hair, and it turns orange, you may be \\nlooking at your natural, previously hidden pheomelanin.\\nBoth pigments are made from an amino acid called tyrosine. Dif-\\nferent enzymes‚Äîwhose instructions are encoded in our genome‚Äî\\nconvert tyrosine into a slightly different chemical, and then that \\nchemical into yet another chemical. Eumelanin and pheomelanin \\nare two different end products of this pathway. To make pigmented \\nhair, we also have to get that pigment into the hair in the first place, \\nso there are enzymes that do that job too. Variations in any of these \\nenzymes can affect how much of each pigment makes it into our hair, \\nand thus what color our hair appears.'),\n",

That‚Äôs the idea behind personal \\ngenomics services. From a sample of saliva, they can tell you about \\nsome of the information in your DNA. Here‚Äôs how that happens.\\nFIRST, YOU SPIT\\nA typical DNA testing kit is just a weird-looking tube. Depending on \\nwhat company you ordered it from, it will probably come in a snazzy-\\nlooking box with a set of instructions and a prepaid mailer to return it \\nto the company for analysis. There is also usually a code to enter in a \\nwebsite or app. With this code, the company can connect your name and \\naccount with the sample that shows up in their mailbox. It usually takes \\na while for the DNA to be processed and for you to see your results: four \\nto eight weeks in most cases, but again that depends on the company \\nand on how busy they are at the time of year you send it in.\\nThe tube has a funnel on top, and you spit into this funnel to fill the \\ntube up to a certain line. Usually you need to provide two milliliters of \\nsaliva to be sure there‚Äôs enough DNA to work with, so you‚Äôll spend a few \\nminutes spitting into the tube before you can be sure you have enough.\\nWhy saliva? Let‚Äôs take a quick look at what saliva actually is. \\nGlands in our mouth squirt out the liquid component of saliva, which \\nincludes water, electrolytes, and mucus. Its main jobs include moist-\\nening the food we eat and keeping our mouth healthy in between \\nmeals. Saliva contains enzymes that kill bacteria, for example. This'),\n",

These cells float in our saliva as well, and \\nmake up 0.5 percent of what‚Äôs in that tube.\\nWhen you spit into a tube, you‚Äôre filling that tube mostly with liquid \\nsaliva, but also with those cheek cells and white blood cells that are \\nmixed in. These cells contain what we really want: full sets of our DNA.\\nThe next step, closing the cap, is also an important part of the pro-\\ncess. The cap of the tube contains another liquid, called a buffer, that \\nhelps to preserve the DNA while it sits at room temperature in your \\nhouse and in the mail trucks that take it to the lab. (Otherwise, DNA \\nsamples are usually kept in a freezer.) The buffer is held in the lid by \\nplastic film, and when you close the lid, the plastic is punctured so the \\nbuffer can flow into the tube and mix with your saliva.

Then you drop it in the mail and wait.\\nEXTRACTING DNA FROM   \\nTHE SPIT SAMPLE\\nFirst, the lab extracts the DNA. Cells contain a lot of stuff, but we \\nonly care about the DNA, so we have to break open the cells and \\nget rid of all that other stuff.

Darwin was thinking \\nin terms of phenotypes; so, for example, a population of birds might \\ninclude individuals with larger and smaller beaks.\\nNext, those variations can be inherited. Darwin didn‚Äôt know \\nabout Mendel‚Äôs work, so he wasn‚Äôt familiar with the idea of a gene. \\nBut he had a sense that birds with large beaks would tend to have \\noffspring with large beaks.\\nWe know now that genes are responsible for those variations.

Instead, they can also test DNA for characteristics they‚Äôre \\nlooking for. Plant breeders, for example, use DNA tests to decide \\nwhich individuals to breed together to make offspring with the traits \\nthey‚Äôre looking for.\\nFinally, for natural selection to occur, the population has to be \\nin a situation where not everyone survives to leave offspring. Think \\nabout a pond full of frogs. A pair of bullfrogs could easily produce \\nover ten thousand eggs each year, and each parent lives an average \\nof about eight years. Out of all the eggs they produce, only two need \\nto survive to adulthood to replace their parents. If the population of \\nbullfrogs in the pond stays the same from year to year, that means \\nthat many thousands of each frog‚Äôs offspring will die.\\nThose numbers set up some stiff competition among the baby \\nfrogs.

As \\nthe slower tadpoles get eaten, the alleles related to fast swimming \\nbecome more common in the population.

This explains \\nwhy islands that have been isolated for a very long time tend to have \\nspecies found nowhere else. Take the lemurs of Madagascar, for \\nexample, or the unique marsupials found in Australia.\\nPopulations can also be separated by invisible barriers. Perhaps \\na few individuals in a population get their internal clocks mixed up, \\nand they mate in the fall while their relatives mate in the spring. \\nPretty soon you‚Äôll have two separate populations that don‚Äôt mate \\nwith each other, but live in the same place undergoing the same \\npressures.'),\n",

Breaking down \\nchemicals in our bloodstream is a big part of our liver‚Äôs job, and it \\nhas tons of enzymes to help do this job.\\nOne of those enzymes is called Cytochrome P450 1A2, abbre -\\nviated CYP1A2. There is a single nucleotide variant in this gene: a \\nlarge chunk of the population has an A allele at a certain position, \\nand other people have a C.

One makes the enzyme work more slowly, so that \\nthe person who takes codeine ends up with only a tiny bit of mor-\\nphine coursing through their veins. The result: little to no pain relief. \\nAnother mutation is even more devastating: it makes the CYP2D6 \\nenzyme work too fast, causing a sudden flood of morphine in the \\nbloodstream.

But antibiotics don‚Äôt kill all bacte-\\nria. More and more infections these days are drug resistant, and it‚Äôs \\nall due to what‚Äôs going on in the germs‚Äô genetics.\\nThe First Antibiotic\\nPenicillin, the first antibiotic, was not invented; it was discovered. Alexander \\nFleming, a bacteriologist in London, returned from a vacation in 1928 to find \\nthat one of his Petri plates of Staphylococcus  bacteria had some mold on it. \\nAnd in a halo around this bit of fungus, no bacteria were growing. It took over \\na decade of lab work to figure out how to extract and purify the drug from the \\nfungus in great enough quantities to use it in medicine.\\nThe word antibiotics  means ‚Äúagainst life,‚Äù but the way most \\npeople use the word, it means antibacterial drugs. There are also \\nantifungal drugs, antiviral drugs, and antibacterial chemicals that \\naren‚Äôt drugs. Their stories are similar, but in this section we‚Äôre look -\\ning at bacteria-killing drugs.\\nThe more than one hundred antibiotics used in medicine come \\nin different classes.

But some types of bacteria also \\nhave a cell wall, a thick barrier made of proteins and sugars that \\nacts as the cell‚Äôs armor. To build the cell wall, the bacterium has to \\nlink chains of proteins together. An enzyme called PBP does this \\njob, grabbing a certain kind of amino acid chain and using it to \\nlock the proteins together. Beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillin \\nare roughly the same shape as the amino acids PBP needs. But \\nwhen the PBP grabs the antibiotic, the antibiotic gets stuck. That \\nPBP is now out of commission and can‚Äôt finish building the wall. \\nWith enough of the antibiotic around, the bacteria can‚Äôt build \\ntheir cell walls, and they can‚Äôt survive. This enzyme is named \\nafter the antibiotic, by the way: PBP stands for penicillin-binding \\nprotein. Beta-lactam antibiotics include penicillin, amoxicillin, \\ncephalosporins, and carbapenems.\\n‚Ä¢ Macrolide antibiotics: Bacteria, like other forms of life, use ribo-\\nsomes to translate mRNA transcripts into proteins. Macrolide \\nantibiotics attach to bacterial ribosomes, which fortunately are \\nbuilt just a little differently from human ribosomes (so the medi -\\ncine kills the bacteria, but doesn‚Äôt kill us). Erythromycin is one \\nexample of a macrolide. If you‚Äôve ever taken a Z-Pak, you‚Äôve had \\nazithromycin, another macrolide.\\n‚Ä¢ Quinolone antibiotics:  When bacteria divide, they have to \\nduplicate their DNA (so do we, of course). To do this, they have \\nto separate the two strands of DNA, but this is a tricky job when \\nyou remember that DNA is twisted. Next time you happen across \\na ball of yarn, try grabbing the middle of a strand and pulling it \\napart. The fibers of the yarn are wrapped around each other, and \\nwhen you pull them, they‚Äôll end up curling even tighter.

Quinolones include the fluoroquinolone antibiotics levo -\\nfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (Cipro).\\nRESISTANCE IS ALL ABOUT  \\nBACTERIAL GENES\\nEach class of antibiotics works on a certain bacterial protein: penicil-\\nlin binds to PBP, macrolides mess with ribosomes, and quinolones \\njam up the enzyme that unwinds DNA. That means that bacteria can \\ndodge the effects of these drugs if they can just change how they \\nmake these enzymes. In other words, they can benefit if they get just \\nthe right mutation in their DNA.\\nSome of the bacteria that could be killed by beta-lactam antibiot-\\nics contain some special genes for enzymes called beta-lactamases. \\nThese enzymes can destroy the antibiotic molecule, ripping it apart. \\nEven though penicillin has only been used medically since the \\n1940s, the fungus that makes it must have been around a lot longer. \\nThe beta-lactamase enzymes may be over a billion years old.\\nAnother tactic to dodge the damage of beta-lactam drugs is to \\ntweak PBP so that the antibiotic can‚Äôt bind as well. This is how MRSA, \\nor methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , accomplishes the \\nmethicillin resistance that is its claim to fame.\\nMacrolide resistance usually comes from a change to the ribo -\\nsome.

Another \\ncommon means of resistance is for the bacterium to acquire efflux \\nproteins. These are pumps that can move antibiotic molecules out \\nof the cell. Efflux pumps can remove many different kinds of chemi-\\ncals, so if a cell can pump out quinolones, it can often pump out other \\nantibiotics too.\\nThe mutations mentioned here are only some of the sources of \\nantibiotic resistance.

A technique called the polymerase chain \\nreaction (PCR) can amplify a tiny tissue sample from a crime scene into \\nenough DNA for analysis. Personal genomics companies also use PCR \\nto get usable DNA out of the small number of cells floating in your spit \\nsample.

These are enzymes naturally \\nmade by bacteria, and each one has a specific sequence that it rec -\\nognizes and then cuts unevenly. You can use this enzyme to cut a \\ngene of interest out of any old DNA, and then use the same enzyme \\nto cut a plasmid (a tiny circular piece of DNA that bacteria can \\ncarry). Because the enzyme recognizes a certain sequence, and cuts \\nit unevenly, each of the places that was cut has a length of unpaired \\nDNA with a certain sequence. And it just so happens that all of the \\nunevenly cut ends are able to match with each other. That means you \\ncan take the gene you just cut and insert it into the plasmid.\\nOnce you have a plasmid containing a gene you‚Äôd like to work \\nwith, you can introduce it into bacteria.
